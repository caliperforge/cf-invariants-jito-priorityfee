//!
//! modified to include INTERMEDIATE_HASH prefix and sha256 hashing

// cf-invariants-jito-priorityfee port (anchor 0.31.1 -> 1.0.1):
//   anchor-lang 1.0.1's `solana_program` shim no longer re-exports the `hash`
//   module (it was split out of the monolithic solana-program crate during the
//   modular solana-3.x interface restructure). The standalone
//   `solana-sha256-hasher` 3.x crate is the modular replacement and exposes the
//   same `hashv(&[&[u8]]) -> Hash` API that `solana_program::hash::hashv` used to.
//   The `as &[u8]` coercions also resolve an E0308 the old upstream avoided
//   purely by inference: with all three hashv args explicitly typed as `&[u8]`,
//   the slice element type unifies without complaining about the prefix
//   `&[1u8]`'s size-1 array vs the size-32 hash arrays.
//   (Precedent: cf-invariants-jito tip-distribution port.)
